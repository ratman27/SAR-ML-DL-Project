SAR image colorization using Deep Learning Model
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a type of radar technology used to create detailed images of landscapes and objects, even in bad weather or at night. SAR image is an active microwave-based imaging. Being the wavelength longer, images are not affected by clouds, haze, and other meteorological conditions that otherwise affect visible images.

PROBLEM: Lack of color information and severe speckle noise make image interpretation a challenging task even for well-trained remote sensing experts 

Idea: Take an SAR image, and an MS image of the same area; use the colours from the MS(Multispectral) image to colorize the SAR image.
